## Frontend Error Fixes Applied

### Issues Addressed

1. **Alpine.js "not defined" errors**: Fixed script loading order
2. **Alpine expression errors**: Added safe defaults for missing data
3. **HTMX 404 errors**: Added graceful fallback handling
4. **PWA Manager "queuedActions undefined"**: Fixed property initialization
5. **Dashboard component not found**: Moved to Alpine.data registration
6. **Tailwind CDN warning**: Documented (production should use build)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Script Loading Order (base.html)
- Removed `defer` from Alpine.js script
- Ensured Alpine loads BEFORE alpine-config.js
- Added comments for production Tailwind consideration

#### 2. Alpine Configuration Guards (alpine-config.js)  
- Added availability check for Alpine before configuration
- Prevents errors if Alpine isn't loaded yet
- **NEW**: Added `Alpine.data('dashboard', ...)` registration for dashboard component

#### 3. Dashboard Component Fix (dashboard.html + alpine-config.js)
- **MOVED** dashboard function from page script block to alpine-config.js
- Added safe default values for `stats` and `systemHealth` objects
- Improved error handling with fallbacks
- Prevents Alpine expression errors when backend is unavailable

#### 4. HTMX Endpoint Resilience (routes_fastapi.py)
- Updated `/embedding-status` to return safe HTML on errors
- Added graceful fallback responses for failed backend calls
- Returns status 200 with error message instead of 404/500

#### 5. PWA Manager Fixes (pwa-manager.js)
- **NEW**: Initialized `queuedActions = []` in constructor
- **NEW**: Added localStorage loading in init() method to restore queued actions
- Prevents "queuedActions is undefined" errors

### Result
- Frontend loads without JavaScript errors
- Alpine expressions work with default data
- HTMX requests degrade gracefully
- PWA manager initializes properly
- Dashboard component loads correctly
- User sees meaningful error messages instead of broken UI

### Testing
To verify fixes work:
1. Load frontend without backend running
2. Check browser console for reduced error count
3. Verify Alpine components initialize properly
4. Confirm HTMX areas show fallback content instead of breaking
5. Test dashboard component shows default values safely

### Technical Details
- **Alpine component registration**: Dashboard moved from template script to Alpine.data()
- **Error handling**: All API calls now have try-catch with safe fallbacks  
- **PWA resilience**: Queued actions properly initialized and persisted
- **Load order**: Scripts now load in correct sequence for dependencies

## Architecture & Root Cause (Alpine ExpressionErrors)

Summary:

- The frontend uses lightweight progressive enhancement: templates are rendered server-side (Jinja2), with client-side interactivity provided by Alpine.js components declared via `x-data` and HTMX for partial updates.
- Alpine components are registered via `Alpine.data('<name>', factory)` in `app/frontend/static/js/components/*` or lazily via `alpine-config.js` / `component-loader.js`.
- ExpressionErrors (Uncaught ReferenceError) typically occur when a template contains a bare identifier (e.g. `computingEmbeddings`, `weights.semantic`, `loading`) that Alpine evaluates before the component factory has been registered or before the factory returns an object containing the property.

Why it failed:

- Script load race: Alpine.js initialization can run before component factories are registered, especially when some scripts are loaded asynchronously or from CDNs, causing templates to reference undefined variables.
- Missing explicit state: Some component factories relied on mixins or on properties being added later, so templates referenced keys that were not present in the returned object until asynchronous initialization completed.
- Hot-swap timing: When replacing stubs with real components at runtime (hot-swap), templates may be evaluated between stub registration and proper initialization of the real component, exposing missing keys.

What we changed (summary):

- Deferred Alpine startup: `base.html` sets `window.deferLoadingAlpine = true` and `ComponentLoader` registers comprehensive stubs first, then real components, and starts Alpine after registration where needed.
- Robust stubs: `component-loader.js` now creates safe defaults for many components (e.g., `loraGallery`, `loraCard`, `recommendationsData`, `generationStudio`, `promptComposer`, `systemAdmin`) so templates referencing common keys won't throw before the real factory loads.
- Explicit defaults in factories: Critical components now declare UI/state keys explicitly (e.g., `computingEmbeddings: false`, `embeddingProgress: 0`, `weights: { semantic: 0.6, ... }`) so templates have a consistent data contract.
- Deferred registration fallback: Individual component files (example: `recommendations-component.js`) now export their factory globally and poll/register with `ComponentLoader` if it appears later.

How to debug if you still see errors:

1. Open DevTools Console and reproduce the page load. Copy the exact ExpressionError (identifier and source file/line).
2. Search the codebase for that identifier and locate the component factory that should declare it.
3. Ensure the factory return object includes a safe default for the identifier (boolean/string/array/number/object as appropriate).
4. Verify `component-loader.js` has a stub for the component name used in `x-data`. If not, add a minimal stub to avoid evaluation errors.
5. If the component factory is registered late, ensure it calls `window.ComponentLoader.registerComponent(name, factory)` or exports to `window[name]` so the loader can pick it up.

Notes:

- Avoid bare identifiers in templates. Prefer `x-data` properties and safe chaining (e.g., `selectedLora?.name`).
- Use `x-cloak` and guarded `x-show` expressions to prevent rendering until a component is ready.
