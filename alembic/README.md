Alembic migration folder for the LoRA Manager Backend

How to use

- Configure DATABASE_URL in the environment (recommended) or edit `alembic.ini`.
- Create an autogenerated revision:
  ```bash
  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial"
  ```
- Apply migrations:
  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```

Notes
- `env.py` attempts to import `ENGINE` from the project's `db.py`. If present, it will reuse that engine; otherwise it will construct an engine from the configured URL.
- For SQLite, `env.py` uses batch mode to allow more ALTER operations.
