# TODO Items Resolved - Summary

## 1. ✅ Code Duplication in backend/main.py - API Router Prefixes

**Issue**: API routers were potentially included multiple times with inconsistent prefixes.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `backend/main.py` to use consistent `/api/v1` prefix for all versioned API endpoints
- Dashboard routes use `/api` prefix for frontend compatibility  
- WebSocket routes remain unprefixed as they don't require versioning
- All routes now have clear, consistent prefixing structure

**Changes**:
- Modified router inclusions to use proper prefixes
- Added clear comments explaining the reasoning for different prefixes

## 2. ✅ Deprecated File Removal - app/frontend/routes.py

**Issue**: The deprecated Flask-based routes file was still present, causing potential confusion.

**Solution**:
- Completely removed `app/frontend/routes.py` 
- All functionality has been migrated to `app/frontend/routes_fastapi.py`
- This eliminates code rot and removes confusion about which file to use

**Changes**:
- Deleted the deprecated file entirely

## 3. ✅ Hardcoded URLs Configuration

**Issue**: Frontend code contained hardcoded URLs (http://localhost:8000) making deployment difficult.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced both backend and frontend configuration management
- Added environment variable support throughout the application
- Created comprehensive configuration classes
- Updated all hardcoded URL references to use configuration

**Changes**:

### Backend Configuration (`backend/core/config.py`):
- Added `BACKEND_HOST`, `BACKEND_PORT`, and `BACKEND_URL` settings
- Added `get_backend_url()` property for flexible URL construction
- Supports both explicit URL override and host/port construction

### Frontend Configuration (`app/frontend/config.py`):
- Updated to use Pydantic v2 syntax (`pydantic-settings`, `field_validator`)
- Added `backend_host`, `backend_port` configuration options
- Smart URL construction when individual components are provided
- Enhanced validation and environment variable support

### Route Updates (`app/frontend/routes_fastapi.py`):
- Removed hardcoded `BACKEND_URL` constant
- Integrated with `FrontendSettings` for dynamic configuration
- Updated all API calls to use configured URLs with correct `/api/v1/` prefixes
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing templates

### Development Configuration (`vite.config.js`):
- Updated to use environment variables for proxy configuration
- Added support for `BACKEND_URL` and `WEBSOCKET_URL` environment variables
- Improved development server flexibility

### Documentation (`.env.example`):
- Created comprehensive example environment file
- Documented all available configuration options
- Included comments explaining usage for each setting
- Covers backend, frontend, database, security, and feature flag options

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Deployment Flexibility**: Applications can now be easily deployed to different environments by setting environment variables
2. **Code Cleanliness**: Removed deprecated code and duplicate router registrations
3. **Consistency**: All API endpoints now follow consistent URL patterns
4. **Maintainability**: Configuration is centralized and well-documented
5. **Development Experience**: Developers can easily customize settings for their environment

## Usage

To use the new configuration system:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Customize the values for your environment
3. Start the application - it will automatically use the configured values

Example:
```bash
# For development
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
BACKEND_HOST=localhost
BACKEND_PORT=8000

# For production
BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourapp.com/api
BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
BACKEND_PORT=80
```

All hardcoded URLs have been eliminated, making the application truly portable and production-ready.
