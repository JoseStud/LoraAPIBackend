# Frontend Code Quality Fix Summary

## Current Migration Snapshot
- `vue-tsc --noEmit` and `eslint app/frontend/src --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.vue` now run cleanly on the SPA source.
- ESLint has been converted to a TypeScript/Vue-aware config (`.eslintrc.cjs`) so the Composition API codebase is linted with the same conventions as the service layer.
- Legacy Alpine/HTMX bundles have been fully removed from `app/frontend/static/js/`, leaving the Vue SPA as the sole UI surface.

## Hardened Vue Components
- Added a guarded debug logger for `GenerationStudio.vue`, replacing raw `console.log` calls and ensuring WebSocket telemetry only appears in development builds.
- `SystemStatusPanel.vue` now clamps and formats nullable metrics before rendering, preventing `undefined%` and `undefined°C` strings in the dashboard UI.
- `RecommendationsPanel.vue` forwards weight sliders through the API query, keeping the template and service layer in sync.
- `SystemStatusCardDetailed.vue` now sanitises optional props (labels, memory stats) with computed fallbacks so the template never renders `undefined` values and the Vue `withDefaults` warning is eliminated.

## Test Suite Updates
- Vitest specs now mock the service layer (`generationService`, `loraService`) instead of raw `fetch`, aligning unit tests with the composable-based API abstractions.
- Mobile navigation tests use `window.dispatchEvent` so Escape-key handling matches the real component lifecycle.
- System status formatting expectations were refreshed to reflect the new human-friendly size formatter.

## Remaining JavaScript Surface Area
- Removed legacy bundles live in history only; future work focuses on Vue composables and Pinia stores.
- `tests/vue/**/*.js` – Vitest suites will be migrated to TypeScript after the component API stabilises.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Sweep remaining `withDefaults(defineProps())` destructuring patterns (e.g. `SystemStatusCardSimple.vue`) so future Vue upgrades stay warning-free.
2. Gradually port the Vitest suites to `.ts` once service mocks settle, ensuring full type safety in tests.
3. Audit Pinia stores for redundant legacy helpers now that the Alpine compatibility layer is gone.

## Key API Abstractions in Use
- `useApi` + `apiClients` composables centralise all REST calls with shared error handling.
- Service modules (`generationService`, `loraService`, `systemService`) expose typed operations that components/tests can mock independently.
- Stores (`useAppStore`, `useSettingsStore`) remain the source of truth for system status and runtime configuration, keeping network wiring out of the templates.

## Validation
- ✅ `pnpm run type-check`
- ✅ `pnpm run lint`
- ✅ `pnpm run test:unit`
