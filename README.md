# LoRA Manager

A comprehensive FastAPI backend with a modern Vue 3 frontend for managing LoRA adapters, composing prompts, and generating images via SDNext integration. The project features AI-powered recommendations, real-time WebSocket monitoring, and a sophisticated service architecture with dependency injection patterns.

## 📊 Project Health

**Architecture Status**: 🟡 **Refactoring in Progress**  
The codebase demonstrates strong engineering foundations but has identified complexity hotspots requiring architectural attention. Recent branch activity shows excellent momentum toward improved modularity and maintainability.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Backend**: 22+ services with dependency injection patterns
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 SPA with Pinia state management and composables
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites across Python and TypeScript
- **Documentation**: Complete API specifications and development guides

**Recent Improvements**:
- ✅ Service provider refactoring with explicit dependency injection
- ✅ Component decomposition (ImportExport → specialized panels)
- ✅ Shared Pydantic model standardization
- ✅ Analytics containerization and coordinator patterns
- 🔄 **Current Focus**: Service registry builder adoption and composable extraction

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development (Two-Terminal Setup)

**Terminal 1: Backend Server**
```bash
# Install Python dependencies with AMD GPU support
pip install -r requirements-amd.txt

# Run development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2: Frontend Development Server**
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Run Vite development server with hot reload
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** Node packages are not vendored in this repository. Run `npm install` (or `npm ci`) locally after cloning and keep the generated `node_modules/` directory out of version control.

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

By default the SPA calls the backend relative to the same origin at `/api/v1`. If you run the backend separately (for example on another host or port), set the `BACKEND_URL` environment variable to the full base path such as `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` before starting the FastAPI wrapper.

### Alternative Development Workflow
```bash
# Option 1: Run both backend and frontend simultaneously
npm run dev:full

# Option 2: Backend only (serves frontend from dist/)
npm run build  # Build frontend assets first
npm run dev:backend

# Option 3: CSS development (Tailwind watch mode)
npm run dev:css
```

### Production
```bash
# Build frontend assets
npm run build

# Run in production mode
ENVIRONMENT=production uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Service Architecture

The backend implements a sophisticated service registry with explicit dependency injection:

```python
from backend.services import get_service_container_builder

# Typed service registry built via the shared builder
builder = get_service_container_builder()
services = builder.build(session)

# Domain facades expose rich service APIs
adapters = services.domain.adapters            # LoRA adapter management
recommendations = services.domain.recommendations  # AI-powered suggestions
analytics = services.domain.analytics          # Metrics and insights
generation = services.application.generation_coordinator  # Image orchestration
deliveries = services.application.deliveries   # Queue management
archive = services.application.archive         # Import/export workflows
websocket = services.application.websocket     # Real-time communication
```

**Key Patterns**:
- **Factory Functions**: Provider pattern for service instantiation
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for complex queries
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Orchestration of multi-service workflows
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean service composition and testing

### Frontend Architecture

The Vue 3 frontend demonstrates modern SPA practices with component decomposition and sophisticated state management:

```typescript
// Composable-based architecture for complex state
const { jobs, polling, websocket } = useJobQueue({
  pollInterval: 2000,
  disabled: !isOnline
})

// Specialized components with clear responsibilities  
<GenerationHistory>
  <GenerationHistoryHeader />
  <GenerationHistoryFilters />
  <GenerationHistoryGrid />
</GenerationHistory>

// Pinia stores for centralized state management
const generationStore = useGenerationQueueStore()
const resultsStore = useGenerationResultsStore()
```

**Technology Stack**:
- **Vue 3 + Composition API**: Modern reactive framework with composables
- **Pinia**: Type-safe state management with devtools support
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with hot module replacement
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with design system
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire frontend
- **PWA**: Offline support with service worker integration

See [Architectural Complexity Analysis](ARCHITECTURAL_COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed refactoring roadmap.

## 🧪 Testing

The repository contains extensive test scaffolding, but many suites depend on optional services (Redis, SDNext, Playwright browsers, Lighthouse) or large ML models. Use targeted commands when developing locally and expect to configure additional tooling before everything passes.

### Backend Tests (Python)
```bash
# Run all Python tests (requires optional services for queue & SDNext flows)
pytest -v

# Focused suites
pytest tests/test_services.py -v         # Core services and adapters
pytest tests/test_generation_jobs.py -v  # SDNext queue helpers (needs SDNext/Redis)
```

### Frontend Tests (JavaScript)
```bash
# Run Vitest unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration & browser-driven suites (require Playwright deps)
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Optional tooling
npm run test:performance  # Lighthouse (needs Chrome & credentials)
npm run test:coverage     # Vitest coverage + Coveralls upload
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Linting and formatting
npm run lint              # ESLint code analysis  
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run validate          # Run linting + tests

# Python code quality
pytest --cov             # Python test coverage
```
