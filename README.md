### Service Architecture

The backend implements a sophisticated service layer with dependency injection:

```python
# Service Container with 12+ specialized services
services = ServiceContainer(
    db_session=session,
    adapters=AdapterService,           # LoRA adapter management
    recommendations=RecommendationService,  # AI-powered suggestions
    analytics=AnalyticsService,        # Metrics and insights
    generation=GenerationCoordinator,  # Image generation orchestration
    deliveries=DeliveryService,        # Job queue management
    archive=ArchiveService,            # Import/export workflows
    websocket=WebSocketService,        # Real-time communication
    # ... and more specialized services
)
```

**Key Patterns**:
- **Factory Functions**: Provider pattern for service instantiation
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for complex queries
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Orchestration of multi-service workflows
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean service composition and testing

### Frontend Architecture

The Vue 3 frontend demonstrates modern SPA practices with component decomposition and sophisticated state management:

```typescript
// Composable-based architecture for complex state
const { jobs, polling, websocket } = useJobQueue({
  pollInterval: 2000,
  disabled: !isOnline
})

// Specialized components with clear responsibilities  
<GenerationHistory>
  <GenerationHistoryHeader />
  <GenerationHistoryFilters />
  <GenerationHistoryGrid />
</GenerationHistory>

// Pinia stores for centralized state management
const generationStore = useGenerationQueueStore()
const resultsStore = useGenerationResultsStore()
```

**Technology Stack**:
- **Vue 3 + Composition API**: Modern reactive framework with composables
- **Pinia**: Type-safe state management with devtools support
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with hot module replacement
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with design system
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire frontend
- **PWA**: Offline support with service worker integration

## 🧪 Testing

The repository contains extensive test scaffolding, but many suites depend on optional services (Redis, SDNext, Playwright browsers, Lighthouse) or large ML models. Use targeted commands when developing locally and expect to configure additional tooling before everything passes.

### Backend Tests (Python)
```bash
# Run all Python tests (requires optional services for queue & SDNext flows)
pytest -v

# Focused suites
pytest tests/test_services.py -v         # Core services and adapters
pytest tests/test_generation_jobs.py -v  # SDNext queue helpers (needs SDNext/Redis)
```

### Frontend Tests (JavaScript)
```bash
# Run Vitest unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration & browser-driven suites (require Playwright deps)
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Optional tooling
npm run test:performance  # Lighthouse (needs Chrome & credentials)
npm run test:coverage     # Vitest coverage + Coveralls upload
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Linting and formatting
npm run lint              # ESLint code analysis  
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run validate          # Run linting + tests

# Python code quality
pytest --cov             # Python test coverage
```
