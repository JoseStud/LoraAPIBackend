2. **Feature Branch Strategy**: Isolated development with comprehensive testing before integration  
3. **Builder Pattern Implementation**: Clean service construction with explicit dependencies
4. **Event-Driven Decoupling**: Reduce tight coupling through type-safe event systems
5. **Contract-First Development**: Define interfaces before implementation for better testing

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

#### **Technical Risk Management**
```python
# Risk mitigation through feature flags
class FeatureFlags:
    def __init__(self):
        self.flags = {
            'use_new_service_container': False,
            'enable_lazy_loading': False,
            'use_event_driven_generation': False
        }
    
    def is_enabled(self, flag: str) -> bool:
        return self.flags.get(flag, False)

# Gradual rollout implementation
class ServiceContainerFactory:
    def create_container(self, session: Session) -> ServiceContainer:
        if FeatureFlags().is_enabled('use_new_service_container'):
            return NewServiceContainerBuilder().with_session(session).build()
        else:
            return LegacyServiceContainer(session)
```

#### **Rollback Capabilities**
- **Database Migrations**: Reversible Alembic migrations for schema changes
- **Feature Toggles**: Instant rollback to previous implementations
- **Branch Strategy**: Maintain stable main branch during refactoring
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and error rate monitoring
