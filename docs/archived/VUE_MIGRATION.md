# Vue 3 Migration Completion Report

The LoRA Manager frontend now runs exclusively as a Vue 3 single-page application. All user workflows – dashboard analytics, generation studio, LoRA administration, import/export, history review, and recommendations – render through Vue Router views that hydrate a single `<div id="app">` root served by FastAPI.

## SPA Architecture Overview

- **Entry point:** `app/frontend/src/main.ts` mounts the app, registers the router, and attaches a shared Pinia instance for cross-workflow state.
- **Routing:** `app/frontend/src/router/index.ts` defines top-level routes for Dashboard, Generate, Compose, History, LoRAs, Recommendations, and Admin tooling. Nested layouts keep navigation, toasts, and shared chrome consistent across all screens.
- **State management:** Pinia stores power queue telemetry, prompt composition, gallery filters, system status, and admin controls. Components subscribe through composables instead of mutating globals.
- **API access:** Composables in `src/composables/` wrap backend calls with typed helpers, standardized error handling, and automatic backend URL resolution.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS scans Vue single-file components (`.vue`) exclusively. The CSS input pipeline lives in `app/frontend/static/css/input.css` and is compiled into `src/assets/css/styles.css` during development and build.

## Legacy Surface Retirement

The Alpine.js/HTMX era is fully retired. Cleanup included:

1. **Code removal:** Deleted `app/frontend/static/js/**/*`, Alpine loaders, and HTMX glue code. `index.html` now references only the Vite-generated bundles.
2. **Template consolidation:** Removed the legacy `app/frontend/templates/` directory in favor of the Vue SPA shell. FastAPI serves the Vite build from `dist/` in production.
3. **Testing updates:** Replaced Jest + Alpine mocks with Vitest suites that mount Vue components directly. Shared setup lives in `tests/setup/vitest.setup.js` and Pinia-aware helpers under `tests/mocks/`.
4. **Tooling:** Dropped npm scripts tied to Alpine asset builds, standardized on Vite commands, and migrated linting to Vue/TypeScript aware rules.
5. **Documentation:** Updated onboarding docs, architecture guides, and release notes to describe the Vue-only stack.

## Developer Workflow

1. Start the FastAPI backend via `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`.
2. Run the Vite dev server with `npm run dev` to access the SPA on port 5173.
3. Use Pinia Devtools and Vue Devtools during development; all workflows route through the same SPA entry point.
4. Build production assets with `npm run build`, then serve them through FastAPI or any static host.

## Validation & Quality Gates

- **Static analysis:** `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, and Tailwind builds operate solely on Vue sources.
- **Unit & integration tests:** `npm run test:unit` exercises Vue components, stores, and composables through Vitest.
- **E2E coverage:** `npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright scenarios against the SPA to ensure router-driven navigation continues to work without Alpine fallbacks.
- **Backend assertions:** `tests/unit/test_frontend_structure.py` verifies the absence of legacy Alpine bundles and validates the SPA shell.

## Next Focus Areas

- Expand Pinia store test coverage for long-running queue orchestration and admin workflows.
- Continue migrating any legacy utility code in `src/utils` into typed composables where practical.
- Monitor bundle size and shared dependency usage now that every workflow lives under a single Vue entry point.

The migration is complete; Vue Router and Pinia own the entire UI surface and Alpine assets no longer ship with the application.
